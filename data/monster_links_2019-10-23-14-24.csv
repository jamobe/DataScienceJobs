This role will expand your abilities through working alongside our wealth of specialist data scientists and software engineers on various projects, from rapidly prototyped research right through to high grade enterprise systems. Roke delivers advanced research, development services and products and is a vendor neutral supplier picking the most appropriate technologies to achieve the required performance and capabilities. Roke staffs its teams with the most appropriate individuals, although it’s rare to have nothing new to learn on a project so an enthusiasm to learn and adapt to new technical challenges is vital for this role. Many of our projects are highly creative, so we are looking for individuals who have the ability to think around and propose solutions to problems. All our data scientists need to communicate to a high standard and work effectively in multi-skilled teams, so good written and verbal communication skills are fundamental. Applicants who would prefer more flexible working arrangements, such as reduced hours, would be welcome to apply for this role. What will your role look like? You will be developing data science solutions within one or more of our client side teams. If you have the experience, you could also provide technical leadership to junior members of staff and interacting with stakeholders during the development cycle. Our data analytics work encompasses all types of data, including structured and unstructured data (such as text and image). Projects vary greatly depending on the customer and their requirements. We use a variety of software, picking the best approach to suit the customers’ needs. For example, you might exploit your software expertise to solve big data or data streaming challenges using open source technologies. Alternatively, you might use your statistical background to develop machine learned models to classify data. Or, perhaps you will specialise in data visualisation techniques in order to enable our customers to easily access the required information from their data. Location can vary and should your role require you to attend client sites, you will be encouraged to spend a proportion of your time at our Roke base site (Romsey or Gloucester) contributing to the Roke’s technical innovation and data science community.  What do we need from you? You will ideally hold a degree qualification in computer science, software engineering, data science, mathematics, physics or similar. Alternatively you will have similar experience/education to an equivalent level. You will be an enthusiastic software engineer and will also have experience of multiple programming languages with a passion for high-quality, eligible and maintainable code. You will have data science expertise; however, as this is such a broad area we would consider experience in a subset of any of the following:Large scale (‘big data’) data ecosystems, cloud infrastructure and analytic frameworks.Machine learning and Deep Neural Net technologiesTechniques and toolkits for data cleansing, data preparation, data processing, fusion and analysisTechniques and toolkits for combining data or analysing data streams in real timeProgramming languages and techniques for visualising dataYou will be comfortable working side by side with product managers, designers, and clients, making decisions together in order to quickly deliver valuable working software to clients and their users. You enjoy growing your skills and those of your team and you regularly learn about new technologies. Most importantly, you judge your achievements by the success and happiness of your team and its customers. As an effective communicator you will have experience consulting or teaching and enjoy mentoring junior developers, helping them push their boundaries and abilities. You value transparency and continuous improvement in your development team. Roke also operates in the fields of network communications, network connectivity, autonomy and cyber and your familiarity with underpinning concepts in one or more of these areas would be beneficial. What we can offer you? This position offers a competitive salary and benefits package, including bonus scheme, private medical insurance employee assistance program and pension, along with a whole host of flexible benefits to include childcare vouchers, travel insurance and dental care. Our working environment is friendly, innovative and inclusive. We can accommodate flexible working arrangements, and support a diverse work-force and those with additional needs. SecurityA current DV clearance is highly preferable, however, due to the nature of this position, candidates will ideally already hold or be eligible to achieve SC clearance.Should you already hold clearance, we will assist you in the transfer of this as well as offer a high level clearance bonus. We are committed to a policy of Equal Opportunity, Diversity, and Inclusion.
